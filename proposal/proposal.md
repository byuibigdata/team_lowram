### <p style="text-align: center;">Team Lowram Machine Learning Proposal</p>

We propose a machine learning algorithm that predicts the amount of checkouts for any particular book in Seattle Public Library's (SPL) inventory for a given fiscal quarter. We suggest using the book title, fiscal quarter of previous checkouts, amount of checkouts in that quarter, item count, publisher, author, material type, subject, and publishing date. In addition to predicting checkout totals, we can use book pricing and sales data to determine when, and for how much, a library should sell off a particular piece of inventory. We propose notifying SPL when a book/other piece of media is predicted to have less than x checkouts for each of the next four quarters, helping them manage their inventory and item count. This would be accessible via an interactive web app that we would make as a team.

Thank you for your consideration.
